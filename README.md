The project's title is "DeskBookApplication," an application enabling users to reserve desks for specified time periods.
Our application, DeskBookApplication, allows users to reserve desks for specific time periods and stores the reservations in a database.
In selecting technologies, we prioritized versatility, ease of use, and compatibility with our project requirements.
For the frontend, we chose CSS for styling, EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for templating dynamic content, and JavaScript for client-side interactivity. 
MongoDB was selected as our backend database due to its flexibility and scalability, while Node.js facilitated server-side operations and provided a convenient platform for hosting the application locally.
Throughout development, we encountered various challenges stemming from our limited experience in web development. 
However, our determination to broaden our skill set enabled us to overcome these obstacles and grasp new concepts and technologies along the way.
Looking ahead, we aim to implement additional features to enhance the user experience and functionality of our application.
Some of these features may include user authentication, real-time desk availability updates, and integration of AI algorithms for smart desk allocation based on user preferences and historical data. 
Through continuous learning and iteration, we aspire to evolve DeskBookApplication into a robust and intuitive platform for desk reservation management
